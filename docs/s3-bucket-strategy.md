# S3 Bucket / Folder Strategy

## To Restructure or Not to Restructure: A Deep Dive into Your S3 Bucket Strategy

Your startup's decision to re-evaluate its Amazon S3 bucket strategy is a critical step toward building a scalable and secure web application. While your current approach of combining public and private folders within a single bucket might seem straightforward initially, your proposed modification to a single public bucket for web assets with folders for custom customer implementations raises significant security and management considerations. The expert consensus strongly advises against mixing public and private data within the same S3 bucket due to the inherent security risks.

**The short answer:** You should absolutely modify your current structure. However, instead of a single public bucket with private folders, a more robust and secure approach would be to implement a two-bucket strategy: one dedicated to public web assets and another entirely private bucket for customer-specific data.

### The Pitfalls of a Single Bucket for Public and Private Data

Storing both publicly accessible web assets and private customer data in the same S3 bucket, even with folder separation, introduces a significant risk of data exposure. A simple misconfiguration in your bucket policy or Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles could inadvertently make private customer data public. The principle of least privilege is a cornerstone of cloud security, and physically separating these two distinct data types into different buckets is the most effective way to enforce it.

### The Recommended Two-Bucket Strategy

Here's a breakdown of the recommended two-bucket approach and why it's the industry best practice:

**1. The Public Web Assets Bucket:**

*   **Purpose:** This bucket will store all your publicly accessible assets, such as your website's CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static content.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Public Access:** This bucket can be configured for public read access, allowing users' browsers to directly download the necessary files.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** For improved performance and reduced latency, it's highly recommended to use a CDN like Amazon CloudFront in front of this bucket. A CDN caches your public assets at edge locations around the world, delivering them to users faster.
    *   **Bucket Policy:** The bucket policy should be simple and explicitly grant read-only access to the public.

**2. The Private Customer Data Bucket:**

*   **Purpose:** This bucket is exclusively for storing sensitive, private data belonging to your customers. Each customer's data should be isolated from others.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Block All Public Access:** This is the most critical setting for this bucket. Ensure that "Block all public access" is enabled at the bucket level to prevent any accidental public exposure.
    *   **Tenant Isolation:** You have a few options for isolating customer data within this private bucket:
        *   **Prefix-based Isolation (Recommended):** This is a highly scalable and common approach. You would create a unique "folder" or prefix for each customer (e.g., `s3://private-customer-data/tenant-123/`, `s3://private-customer-data/tenant-456/`). Access to these prefixes is then controlled through granular IAM policies.
        *   **Bucket-per-Tenant:** For the highest level of isolation, you could create a separate private bucket for each customer. However, this can lead to management overhead as your customer base grows and you approach AWS's bucket limits per account.
    *   **IAM Policies and Pre-signed URLs:** Access to the private customer data should be managed programmatically by your web application. Your application, using an IAM role with the necessary permissions, can generate pre-signed URLs that grant temporary, time-limited access to specific objects for authorized users. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access their data.
    *   **Encryption:** All data in this bucket should be encrypted at rest using Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For an added layer of security, you can use customer-managed KMS keys to have even more control over data encryption.

### Comparing Your Current and Proposed Structures to the Best Practice

| **Strategy** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Recommendation** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Current: Single Bucket (Public/Private Folders)** | Simple initial setup. | **High security risk** of accidental data exposure. Complex IAM policies are required to manage access. | **Not Recommended.** Migrate away from this structure as soon as possible. |
| **Proposed: Single Public Bucket (Web/Customer Folders)** | - | **Extremely high security risk.** Makes it very difficult to enforce the principle of least privilege. Violates security best practices. | **Strongly Not Recommended.** |
| **Best Practice: Two Buckets (Public & Private)** | **Strong security and isolation.** Clear separation of concerns simplifies access control and management. Aligns with the principle of least privilege. | Slightly more initial setup and management of two buckets. | **Highly Recommended.** This is the most secure and scalable approach for your multi-tenant application. |

### The Path Forward

Migrating your S3 bucket structure is a critical task that will significantly improve the security and scalability of your web application. Here's a high-level plan for the transition:

1.  **Create the new buckets:** Provision the two new S3 buckets—one for public assets and one for private customer data—with the recommended configurations.
2.  **Migrate the data:** Carefully move your existing public assets and private customer data to their respective new buckets.
3.  **Update your application code:** Modify your application to reference the new bucket locations. For private data, implement the logic to generate pre-signed URLs for authorized access.
4.  **Test thoroughly:** Rigorously test your application to ensure that public assets are loading correctly and that customer data is securely accessible only to authorized users.
5.  **Decommission the old bucket:** Once you are confident that the new structure is working as expected, you can safely delete the old, combined bucket.

By adopting a two-bucket strategy, you will be building your application on a much more secure and robust foundation, giving you and your customers greater peace of mind.
