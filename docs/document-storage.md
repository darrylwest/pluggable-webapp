# Document Storage Strategy

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan for storing encrypted documents in a HIPAA-compliant manner. After evaluating Block Storage and Object Storage (specifically DigitalOcean Spaces), we recommend **DigitalOcean Spaces** for its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and rich feature set. While Block Storage offers a familiar file system interface, its limitations in scalability and higher cost make it less suitable for our long-term needs.

## 2. Key Tasks

- **Implement S3-Compatible Storage:** Utilize DigitalOcean Spaces to store encrypted documents, accessed via the S3 API with TypeScript.
- **Develop Secure File Transfer UI:** Create a web interface for clients to securely upload and download documents.
- **Encryption Strategy:** Implement end-to-end encryption, where documents are encrypted on the client-side before being transferred to storage.
- **Cache Implementation:** Develop a caching layer to store frequently accessed data for the last 10-12 months, with older data archived. **_This applies to database entries, not large documents_**

## 3. Storage Options Analysis

### 3.1. DigitalOcean Block Storage

Block storage provides a raw block device that can be attached to a single Droplet at a time. It functions like a virtual hard drive.

**Advantages:**

- **Familiarity:** Works like a standard filesystem, making it easy to integrate with existing tools and code.
- **Low Latency:** Suitable for high-performance applications like databases.
- **Simplified Upgrades:** Data can be retained while Droplets are upgraded.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Single Point of Access:** Storage is tied to a single server at a time, limiting scalability.
- **Limited Metadata:** Does not natively support rich metadata for objects.
- **Fixed Cost:** You pay for the allocated space, regardless of usage.
- **Manual Management:** Requires more hands-on setup for filesystems, permissions, and backups.

### 3.2. DigitalOcean Spaces (S3-Compatible Object Storage)

Spaces provide an S3-compatible object storage solution, accessible via an HTTP API.

**Advantages:**

- **Scalability:** Easily scales from small to very large storage needs without manual intervention.
- **Cost-Effective:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model means you only pay for what you use.
- **Rich Feature Set:** Includes built-in CDN, versioning, and the ability to store rich metadata.
- **Simplified Architecture:** Reduces the need for managing file servers and backups.
- **Global Availability:** CDN integration provides faster access for users worldwide.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Higher Latency:** Not suitable for applications requiring very low-latency I/O, like databases.
- **API-Based Access:** Requires using an S3-compatible library for integration.
- **Immutable Objects:** Modifying a part of an object requires re-uploading the entire object.

## 4. Alternative Solutions

### 4.1. Google Cloud Storage

- **Pricing:** Approximately $4.90/month for 250 GiB.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Google Cloud offers resources and documentation for building HIPAA-compliant solutions.
- **Compatibility:** Not S3-compatible, which would require using a different set of libraries and tools.

## 5. Cost Analysis

- **DigitalOcean Block Storage:** $0.10 per GiB/month. For 250 GiB, this would be **$25.00/month**.
- **DigitalOcean Spaces:** Starts at $5.00/month for 250 GiB of storage and 1 TiB of outbound transfer.
- **Google Cloud Storage:** Approximately **$4.90/month** for 250 GiB.

DigitalOcean Spaces and Google Cloud Storage are significantly more cost-effective than Block Storage for our expected usage.

## 6. Security and Compliance

Both DigitalOcean and Google Cloud provide resources for building HIPAA-compliant applications. For our implementation, we will ensure:

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Documents are encrypted on the client-side before being uploaded.
- **Secure Data Transfer:** All data is transferred over HTTPS.
- **Access Control:** Strict access control policies are enforced using IAM roles and permissions.

## 7. Recommendation and Conclusion

We recommend using **DigitalOcean Spaces** for our document storage needs. It offers the best combination of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and features. The S3-compatible API is well-supported in the TypeScript ecosystem, and the built-in features like CDN and versioning will simplify our architecture and reduce long-term maintenance overhead.

While Block Storage is easier to set up initially, its limitations make it a less viable long-term solution. The cost savings and scalability of an object storage solution like Spaces are critical for the success of this project.
