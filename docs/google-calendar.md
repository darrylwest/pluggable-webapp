# Google Calendaring

You can embed Google Calendar in your customer-facing web application. You have two primary methods to achieve this: using an iFrame or leveraging the Google Calendar API. The best choice for your application will depend on your desired level of customization, your technical resources, and your specific use case.

***

## ðŸ¦„ Method 1: iFrame Embedding (The Simple Approach)

The quickest and most straightforward way to embed a Google Calendar is by using an iFrame. This method involves generating a snippet of HTML code from your Google Calendar settings and pasting it into your web application.

### Key Considerations for iFrame Embedding:

* **Public Calendar Requirement:** The most significant consideration for this method is that the Google Calendar you want to embed **must be made public**. This means that anyone with the link can view the calendar's events, and it may be indexed by search engines.
* **Limited Customization:** You have some basic customization options provided by Google's embed helper tool. You can adjust the calendar's size, default view (month, week, agenda), and toggle the visibility of elements like the title, navigation buttons, and print icon. However, you cannot alter the fundamental look and feel to match your application's branding.
* **Ease of Implementation:** This method requires no programming knowledge beyond basic HTML. You simply copy and paste the provided code.
* **Cost:** This method is entirely free.

**This approach is best for:** Simple scenarios where a publicly viewable calendar with standard Google branding is sufficient, such as displaying a company's event schedule.

## ðŸš€ Method 2: Google Calendar API (The Customizable & Powerful Approach)

For a truly integrated and branded experience, the Google Calendar API is the recommended path. This method allows you to fetch calendar data directly and display it within a custom-built user interface in your application.

### Key Considerations for the Google Calendar API:

* **Full UI Customization:** The API gives you complete control over the presentation of calendar data. You can design a calendar interface that seamlessly matches your application's branding and user experience.
* **Enhanced Functionality:** Beyond just displaying events, the API allows you to create, edit, and delete events, manage calendars, and set reminders, all from within your application. This enables you to build powerful features for your users.
* **Privacy and Permissions:** Unlike the iFrame method, you do not need to make your calendars public. You can use OAuth 2.0 to request permission from your users to access their Google Calendar data, providing a more secure and private experience. You must have a clear privacy policy that explains to your users how your application will access, use, and store their data.
* **Technical Complexity:** This method requires programming knowledge to interact with the API, handle authentication, and build the user interface.
* **Cost and Usage Quotas:** The Google Calendar API is **free to use**. However, its usage is subject to quotas to ensure fair use. While exceeding these quotas will not result in charges, it will lead to your API requests being temporarily blocked (rate-limited). You can request an increase in your quota, which may require setting up a Google Cloud Platform project with a billing account, although you will still only be charged for other Google Cloud services you choose to use.
* **Branding Guidelines:** When using the API, you must adhere to Google's branding guidelines. This primarily means you cannot use Google's logos or trademarks in a way that suggests your application is an official Google product. You are, however, encouraged to state that your application "works with Google Calendar."

**This approach is best for:** Applications that require a seamless, branded user experience, need to interact with calendar data programmatically, or need to access private calendar information with user consent.

## ðŸ¤” Which Method Should You Choose?

| Feature | iFrame Embedding | Google Calendar API |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customization** | Low (basic color and size adjustments) | High (complete control over UI/UX) |
| **Technical Skill**| Low (copy and paste HTML) | High (requires programming) |
| **Privacy** | Low (requires a public calendar) | High (can access private data with user consent) |
| **Functionality** | Read-only view of events | Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations |
| **Cost** | Free | Free (subject to usage quotas) |

In conclusion, if you need a quick and simple way to display a public calendar and are not concerned with custom branding, the **iFrame method** is a suitable choice. However, for a professional, feature-rich, and seamlessly integrated customer-facing application, the **Google Calendar API** is the superior and recommended solution.

## Automation

How **Push Notifications** Work with Google Calendar

Instead of you repeatedly polling Google Calendar server for changes, push notifications allow the server to proactively notify your application when a change occurs.
This is a more efficient approach that can lead to significant savings in data usage and power, especially for mobile applications.

The core components of this system are:

**Webhook** (Receiving URL): This is a public HTTPS URL that you create and control.[2][3][4] Google's servers will send a POST request to this URL whenever a change happens in a calendar you're "watching".[2]
Notification Channel: You need to set up a notification channel for each calendar resource you want to monitor.[2] This channel tells Google where to send the notifications (your webhook URL).[2]

**Step-by-Step Configuration Guide**

Here are the essential steps to get push notifications up and running:

1. Set Up Your Google Cloud Project

Create a Project: If you haven't already, create a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
Enable the Google Calendar API: In your project's dashboard, navigate to the API library and enable the Google Calendar API.
Create Credentials: You will need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials (a client ID and client secret) to authenticate your application. When setting up your credentials, you will need to specify the authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs.

2. Register Your Domain

Verify Ownership: You must verify that you own the domain where your webhook will be hosted.This is a crucial security step. You can do this through the Google Search Console.
Add Domain to Project: In your Google Cloud project, under "APIs & Auth" and then "Push", you can add your verified domain.

3. Create Your Webhook (Receiving URL)

HTTPS is a Must: Your webhook URL must be an HTTPS address with a valid SSL certificate.[2][3] Self-signed certificates are not accepted.
Handle Incoming POST Requests: This endpoint needs to be able to receive POST requests from Google's servers.

4. Start "Watching" a Calendar

To begin receiving notifications, you need to send a POST request to the watch method of the specific Calendar API resource you want to monitor (e.g., the events resource).
Here's an example of the POST request body:

```json
{
  "id": "YOUR_UNIQUE_CHANNEL_ID",
  "type": "web_hook",
  "address": "https://your-domain.com/notifications"
}
```

Json

* id: A unique string you create to identify this notification channel.
* type: This should be set to "web_hook".
* address: This is your HTTPS webhook URL where notifications will be sent.

If the request is successful, you will receive a response confirming the creation of the notification channel.

5. Handling Notifications

**Initial sync Message:** After you create a channel, Google will send an initial sync message to your webhook to confirm that notifications are starting. You can safely ignore this initial message.

**Notification Content:** When a change occurs in the watched calendar, Google will send a POST request to your webhook. Crucially, the body of this notification will be empty. The notification simply alerts you that a change has occurred.

**Retrieving the Changes:** To find out what actually changed, you need to make another API call to the appropriate resource (e.g., events.list) and use a syncToken or a timestamp to get only the events that have been updated since your last check.
