# Revenue Model Strategy

This revenue model is tailored for solo medical providers and small clinics adopting our HIPAA-compliant booking SaaS.

## 1. Setup & Design Fee (One-Time)

### Inclusions
- Branding (colors, logo)
- Onboarding (calendar, cancellation policy, support)
- Secure setup (Google/Stripe integration)

| Plan             | Fee         | Description                                  |
|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Basic Setup      | $250        | Default templates, no customization          |
| Branded Setup    | $500–$750   | Custom branding, support, config help        |
| Premium Onboarding | $1,000+   | Full-service, integration, priority support  |

## 2. Ongoing Hosting & Maintenance (Monthly)

### Inclusions
- Infrastructure (Droplet, storage, Firebase)
- Maintenance & updates
- Basic email/chat support

| Plan           | Monthly Fee | Description                                          |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Starter        | $29         | 1 provider, up to 100 bookings, basic support        |
| Professional   | $69         | Unlimited bookings, branding, priority support       |
| Clinic (future)| $149+       | Multi-provider, reporting, admin tools               |

_Ok, the clinic still fits our single-provider model, so every provider would have thier own calendar but we would brand them to the clinic's specs and create an umbrella application to enable viewing of patient lists to all providers.  And we we alter the fee structure to by by provider, at around $49/m per provider._
