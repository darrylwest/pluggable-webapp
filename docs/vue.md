# Vue Framework

**Prompt**: I have a 2 member web development team.  As a full stack developer my job is to architect, design and develop applications in typescript with the help of AI.  
My coworker designs the HTML and CSS and relies on me for javascript (typescript) component support.
We currently use tRPC for web client to server communication.
We also use typescript rather than javascript.  Does Vue support that?

I'm interested in possibly moving to vue as a framework, still using tRPC.  my concern is how to integrate the Web pages that she creates with the vue.

Can you give me some ideas on how (or if) that would work?  As a developer I could scrape her HTML and re-generate views, but I don't know if that's practical.  What do you think?

## Gemini Response

Yes, moving to Vue is an excellent choice for your team's workflow, and it integrates perfectly with TypeScript and tRPC. Your idea of scraping your coworker's HTML is unnecessary; there's a much more direct and efficient way to collaborate.

## Vue and TypeScript

Vue 3 was completely rewritten in TypeScript and offers **first-class TypeScript support**. You don't need any complex configuration to get started. In your Vue components, you simply add the `lang="ts"` attribute to the script tag:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// Your TypeScript code goes here
const message: string = 'Hello from Vue and TypeScript!'
</script>
```

This gives you full type-safety for your component's props, reactive state, event emissions, and more, which will feel right at home with your current stack.

## Integrating Your Coworker's HTML & CSS

This is the core of your question, and the solution is elegant: **Vue's Single File Components (SFCs)**. The `.vue` file format is designed for precisely this kind of collaboration. Scraping is not practical and would create a brittle, overwrought process.

A `.vue` file has three sections:

  * `<template>`: For the HTML structure.
  * `<script>`: For the component's logic (TypeScript in your case).
  * `<style>`: For the CSS.

### The Ideal Workflow ü§ù

Here's how you and your coworker can collaborate effectively:

1.  **Design Phase:** Your coworker creates a static HTML file and a corresponding CSS file for a new page or component, just as she does now.
2.  **Integration Phase (Your Job):**
      * Create a new `.vue` file (e.g., `UserProfile.vue`).
      * **Copy her HTML** and paste it directly into the `<template>` section of your new file.
      * **Copy her CSS** and paste it into the `<style>` section. It's best practice to add the `scoped` attribute (`<style scoped>`) to ensure the styles only apply to this component and don't leak out globally.
      * **Add the Logic:** In the `<script setup lang="ts">` section, you write the TypeScript code to make the component dynamic. This is where you'll define reactive data, handle user events, and call your tRPC backend for data.

Here is a simple example:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="user-profile-card">
    <img :src="user.avatarUrl" alt="User avatar">
    <h2>{{ user.name }}</h2>
    <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
    <button @click="updateUser">Update Profile</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
// Assume you have a composable for your tRPC client
import { trpc } from '@/trpc'

const user = ref({ name: 'Loading...', email: '', avatarUrl: '' })

onMounted(async () => {
  // Fetch initial data using your tRPC client
  const userData = await trpc.user.getById.query({ id: '123' })
  if (userData) {
    user.value = userData
  }
})

function updateUser() {
  // Logic to update the user, perhaps calling a tRPC mutation
  console.log('Updating user...')
  trpc.user.update.mutate({ id: '123', name: 'New Name' })
}
</script>

<style scoped>
/* CSS from your coworker goes directly here */
.user-profile-card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  text-align: center;
}

img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
</style>
```

This workflow is **far more practical than scraping**. It's a simple copy-paste-and-enhance process that keeps all related code (structure, style, and logic) for a component in one place.

## Using tRPC with Vue

Integrating tRPC is also straightforward. You can create a **Vue Composable** (a reusable function) to provide the tRPC client to any component that needs it. This keeps your code clean and organized.

Here‚Äôs a basic example of what that might look like:

**1. Create the tRPC client and composable:**

```typescript
// src/trpc.ts
import { createTRPCProxyClient, httpBatchLink } from '@trpc/client';
import type { AppRouter } from '../server/trpc/router'; // Import your router type from the server

const trpc = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  links: [
    httpBatchLink({
      url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/trpc', // URL of your tRPC server
    }),
  ],
});

// You can export the client directly or wrap it in a composable
export { trpc };
```

**2. Use it in a component:**

You can then import and use this `trpc` object directly in your component's script section, as shown in the `UserProfile.vue` example above. The integration is seamless and gives you end-to-end type safety from your database to your Vue template.

## Claude Response

Yes, Vue has excellent TypeScript support! Vue 3 was actually rewritten in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support with great type inference and tooling.

Regarding integrating your coworker's HTML/CSS work with Vue, you have several viable approaches:

## Direct Integration Approaches

**1. Template Conversion**
Your coworker can continue designing in HTML, and you can relatively easily convert her work to Vue templates. Vue's template syntax is very close to HTML - you'd mainly need to:
- Convert `class` to `:class` or `class` (both work)
- Add Vue directives (`v-if`, `v-for`, etc.) where needed
- Replace static content with component props/data

**2. Scoped Slots for Layout**
She could create HTML layouts that you wrap with Vue components using scoped slots. This lets her focus on structure/styling while you handle the dynamic parts.

**3. CSS-in-JS/CSS Modules**
She could provide CSS that you integrate using Vue's CSS modules or scoped styles, while you build the templates.

## Workflow Considerations

**Component-First Approach**: Instead of full pages, consider having her design individual components (cards, buttons, forms) that you then make interactive with Vue. This is often more maintainable.

**Design System**: Establish a component library where she designs the visual aspects and you implement the Vue logic. Tools like Storybook can help bridge this gap.

**Prototyping Workflow**: She could create HTML prototypes that you then "Vue-ify" by adding reactivity, state management, and tRPC integration.

## tRPC Integration

tRPC works excellently with Vue! You can use `@trpc/client` with Vue's reactivity system. The integration is straightforward and maintains type safety throughout.

The "scraping and regenerating" approach you mentioned could work but would likely create friction in your workflow. The direct integration methods above would probably be more sustainable and allow for better collaboration.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or show some specific examples of how the HTML-to-Vue conversion might look?

### Example

Prompt: yes, can you give me a simple login form with email, password and submit button?  And, if possible, show me how Storybook would be used?

### Claude Response

I'll create a simple login form example and show you how both your coworker and you might work with it, plus how Storybook fits in.Now here's how you'd convert that to a Vue component with TypeScript:Now here's how you'd set up Storybook for this component:And here's the Storybook main configuration:## How This Workflow Works

**For Your Coworker (Designer):**

1. She creates the HTML/CSS design (first artifact)
2. Views it in Storybook to see different states, responsive behavior, etc.
3. Can make CSS adjustments and see them immediately
4. Reviews the component in various states without needing to understand Vue/TypeScript

**For You (Developer):**

1. Take her HTML/CSS and convert it to Vue component (second artifact)
2. Add TypeScript interfaces, reactive state, validation
3. Integrate tRPC for API calls
4. Set up Storybook stories (third artifact) for collaboration

**Storybook Benefits:**

- **Design Review**: She can see her designs in various states (loading, errors, mobile)
- **Component Documentation**: Automatically generates docs from TypeScript types
- **Isolated Development**: Test components without full app setup
- **Collaboration**: Both of you can interact with components in different states
- **Quality Assurance**: Test accessibility, responsiveness, and edge cases

**Key Conversion Points:**

- Static HTML becomes Vue template with `v-model`, `v-if`, etc.
- CSS classes can mostly stay the same (scoped styles)
- Form handling becomes reactive with Vue's reactivity system
- tRPC integration handles the API communication with full type safety

The workflow maintains your coworker's design work while letting you add the interactive functionality. Storybook becomes your shared workspace for reviewing and testing components.
